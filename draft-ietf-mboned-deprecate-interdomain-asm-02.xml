    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	IP Multicast has been deployed in various forms, within
	private networks, the wider Internet, and federated networks
        such as national or regional research networks.
        While a number of service models have been published, and in many cases
	revised over time, there has been no strong recommendation
	made by the IETF on the appropriateness of those models to certain scenarios,
        even though vendors and federations have often made such recommendations.
	</t>
	<t>
	This document addresses this gap by making a BCP-level
	recommendation to deprecate the use of ASM for interdomain 
	multicast, leaving SSM as the recommended interdomain mode of
        multicast.  This recommendation thus also implicitly states that 
	all hosts and routers that are expected to support interdomain 
	multicast applications fully support SSM.
      </t>
	<t>
	This document does not make any statement on the use of ASM
	within a single domain or organisation, and therefore
	does not preclude its use. 
	Indeed, there are application contexts for which ASM is currently still 
	widely considered well-suited within a single domain.
        </t>
        <t>
        The main issue in most cases with moving to SSM is application support.
        Many applications are initially deployed for intradomain use and are later
        deployed interdomain. Therefore, this document recommends
        applications support SSM, even when they are initially intended for
        intradomain use. As explained below, SSM applications are
        readily compatible with existing intradomain ASM deployments as SSM 
	is merely a subset of ASM.
	</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
        <section title="Multicast service models">
	  <t>
	  Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
	  are the two multicast service models in use today.  In ASM, as originally 
	  described in <xref target="RFC1112"/>, receivers express interest 
	  in joining a multicast group address and routers use multicast 
	  routing protocols to deliver traffic from 
	  the sender(s) to the receivers.  If there are multiple senders 
	  for a given group, traffic from all senders will be delivered 
	  to the receiver.  Since receivers specify only the group address, 
	  the network, and therefore the multicast routing protocols, are 
	  responsible for source discovery.
          </t>
          <t>
	  In SSM, by contrast, receivers specify both group and source when
	  expressing interest in joining a multicast stream.  Source discovery
	  in SSM is handled by some out-of-band mechanism (ie, the application 
	  layer), which drastically simplifies the network and how the multicast 
	  routing protocols operate.
	  </t>
      	  <t>
	  IANA has reserved specific ranges of IPv4 and IPv6 address
	  space for multicast addressing.
	  Guidelines for IPv4 multicast address assignments
	  can be found in <xref target="RFC5771"/>, while
	  guidelines for IPv6 multicast address assignments
	  can be found in <xref target="RFC2375"/> and
	  <xref target="RFC3307"/>.
	  The IPv6 multicast address format is described
	  in <xref target="RFC4291"/>. 
	  </t>

        </section>

	<section title="ASM routing protocols">

	  <section title="PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)">
      	    <t>
      	    The most commonly deployed ASM routing protocol is Protocol Independent
	    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), as 
	    detailed in <xref target="RFC7761"/>.
	    PIM-SM, as the name suggests, was designed to be used in scenarios
	    where the subnets with receivers are sparsely distributed throughout 
	    the network. 
	    Because receivers do not indicate sender addresses in ASM (but only group addresses), 
	    PIM-SM uses the concept of a Rendezvous Point (RP) as a ‘meeting point’ 
	    for sources and receivers, and all routers in a PIM-SM domain are 
	    configured to use specific RP(s), either explicitly or through
            dynamic RP discovery protocols. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    To enable PIM-SM to work between multiple
	    domains, an interdomain, inter-RP signalling protocol known
	    as Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
	    <xref target="RFC3618"/> is used to allow an RP in one 
	    domain to learn the existence of a source in another domain.
	    Deployment scenarios for MSDP are given in <xref target="RFC4611"/>.
	    MSDP floods information
            about all active sources for all multicast streams to all RPs in all 
	    the domains - even if there is no receiver for a given application in a domain.
	    As a result of this key scalability and security issue, along with
	    other deployment challenges with the protocol,
	    MSDP was never extended to support IPv6 and remains an Experimental protocol.
            </t>
            <t>To this day, there is no IETF Proposed Standard level interdomain solution for
            IPv4 ASM multicast because MSDP was the "best" component for the interdomain
            source discovery problem, and it is Experimental. Other protocol options
            where investigated at the same time but were never implemented or deployed 
            and are now historic (e.g: <xref target="RFC3913"/>).
	    </t>

          </section>

	  <section title="Embedded-RP">

            <t>Due to the availability of more bits in an IPv6 address than in IPv4,
            an IPv6-specific mechanism was designed in support of interdomain 
	    ASM with PIM-SM leveraging those bits.
	    Embedded-RP <xref target="RFC3956"/> allows routers supporting the protocol
	    to determine the RP for the group without any
	    prior configuration or discovery protocols, simply by observing the unicast RP
            address that is embedded (included) in the IPv6 multicast group address.
	    Embedded-RP allows PIM-SM operation across any IPv6 network 
	    in which there is an end-to-end path of routers
            supporting this mechanism, including interdomain deployment.

	  <section title="Bidir-RP">
  
            <t>Bidir-PIM <xref target="RFC5015"/> is another protocol to support ASM.
            There is no standardized option to operate Bidir-PIM interdomain. It is
            deployed intradomain for applications where many sources may want to sent
            traffic to the same IP multicast groups because unlike PIM-SM it does not
            create per-source state. Bidir-PIM is one of the important reasons for this
            document to not deprecate intradomain ASM.</t>

      	<section title="SSM Routing protocols">

      	  <t>
      	  SSM is detailed in <xref target="RFC4607"/>. It mandates the use of 
          PIM-SSM for routing of SSM.  PIM-SSM as it merely a subset of PIM-SM (<xref target="RFC7761"/>).
          </t>
          <t>
	  PIM-SSM expects that the sender’s source address(es)
	  is known in advance by receivers through some out-of-band mechanism (typically 
	  in the application layer), and thus the 
	  receiver's designated router can send a PIM JOIN directly towards the 
	  source without needing to use an RP.
      	  </t>
	  <t>
	  IPv4 addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to
   	  232.255.255.255) range are designated as source-specific multicast
   	  (SSM) destination addresses and are reserved for use by 
	  source-specific applications and protocols. See <xref target="RFC4607"/>.
	  For IPv6, the address prefix 
	  FF3x::/32 is reserved for source-specific multicast use.

    <section title="Discussion">

      <section title="Observations on ASM and SSM deployments">

	<t>
	In enterprise and campus scenarios, ASM in the form of PIM-SM is 
	likely the most commonly deployed 
	multicast protocol.  The configuration and
	management of an RP (including RP redundancy) within a single 
	domain is a well understood operational practice.  However, if interworking
	with external PIM domains is needed in IPv4 multicast deployments,
	interdomain MSDP is required to 
	exchange information about sources between domain RPs. Deployment experience
	has shown MSDP to be a complex and fragile protocol
        to manage and troubleshoot (complex flooding RPF rules, state attack
        protection, filtering of undesired sources, ...). 
	</t>

	<t>
	PIM-SM is a general purpose protocol that can handle all
	use cases. In particular, it was designed for cases such as
	videoconferencing where multiple sources may come and go 
	during a multicast
	session. But for cases where a single, persistent source for a group
        is used, and receivers can be configured to know of that source,
	PIM-SM has unnecessary complexity. Therefore, SSM eliminates the most 
	components of PIM-SM.
	</t>
	<t>
	As explained above, MSDP was not extended to support IPv6. Instead,
        the proposed interdomain ASM solution for PIM-SM with IPv6
	is Embedded-RP, which allows the RP address 
	for a multicast group to be embedded in the group address, 
	making RP discovery automatic for all routers on the path
	between a receiver and a sender.
	Embedded-RP can support lightweight ad-hoc deployments.
	However, it relies
	on a single RP for an entire group that could only be made resilient
        within one domain. While this approach solves the MSDP issues, it does
        not solve the problem of unauthorised sources sending traffic to ASM
        multicast groups; this security issues 
	is one of biggest problem of interdomain multicast.  
	</t>
	<t>
	As stated in RFC 4607, SSM is particularly well-suited to 
	dissemination-style applications with one or more senders 
	whose identities are known (by some oob mechanism) before the 
	application starts running or applications that utilize some
        signaling to indicate the source address of the 
	multicast stream (eg, electronic programming guide
	in IPTV applications).
        PIM-SSM is therefore very well-suited
	to applications such as classic linear broadcast TV over IP.
	</t>

	<t>
	SSM requires applications, host operating systems and the 
	designated routers connected to receiving hosts 
	to support IGMPv3 <xref target="RFC3376"/> and 
	MLDv2 <xref target="RFC3810"/>.  Support for 
	IGMPv3 and MLDv2 has become widespread in common OSes for 
	several years (Windows, MacOS,
        Linux/Android) and is no longer an impediment to SSM deployment.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Advantages of SSM for interdomain multicast" anchor="advantages" >

        <t>This section describes the three key area of benefits that SSM
        with PIM-SSM has over ASM. These benefits also apply 
        to intradomain deployment but are even more important in
        interdomain deployments. See <xref target="RFC4607"/> for
        more details.</t>
  
        <section title="Reduced network operations complexity">
  
	  <t>
	  A significant benefit of SSM is the reduced complexity that comes through
	  eliminating the network-based source discovery required in ASM with PIM-SM. 
	  Specifically, SSM eliminates the need for RPs,
	  shared trees, Shortest Path Tree (SPT) switchovers, PIM registers, 
	  MSDP, dynamic RP discovery mechanisms (BSR/AutoRP) and data-driven 
	  state creation.  SSM simply utilizes a small 
	  subset of PIM-SM, alongside the integration with IGMPv3 / MLDv2, where the
          source address signaled from the receiver is immediately used to
          create (S,G) state. 
	  Eliminating network-based source discovery for interdomain 
	  multicast means the vast majority of the complexity of multicast goes away.
	  </t>
  
	  <t>
	  This reduced complexity makes SSM radically simpler to manage, 
	  troubleshoot and operate, particularly for backbone network
	  operators.  This is the main operator motivation for the recommendation
	  to deprecate the use of ASM in interdomain scenarios.  
          </t>

          <t>Note that this discussion does not apply to Bidir-PIM, and there is
          (as mentioned above) no standardized interdomain solution for Bidir-PIM.
          In Bidir-PIM, traffic is forwarded to an RPs instead o building state as in
          PIM-SM. Even in the absence of receivers. Bidir-PIM therefore trades
          state complexity with (potentially large amounts) of unnecessary traffic.</t>
  
        </section>
  
        <section title="No network wide IP multicast group-address management">
  
          <t>
          In ASM, IP multicast group addresses need to be assigned to applications
          and instances thereof, so that two simultaneously active application instances
          will not share the same group address and receive each others IP multicast traffic.
          </t>
  
          <t>
          Protocols to automate ASM IP multicast group allocations to application instances
          where defined in the 1990'ths, but never widely deployed: MADCAP <xref target="RFC2730"/>,
          MASC <xref target="RFC2909"/> and MZAP <xref target="RFC2776"/>. Today, all
          ASM IP multicast group allocation are based on per-operator, non-standardized
          and mostly manual assignment practices which adds to the operational overhead of supporting ASM.
          </t>
  
          <t>
          In SSM, no such IP multicast group management is necessary. Instead, the IP multicast
          group address simply needs to be assigned locally on a source like a unicast transport
          protocol port number: No two independent applications on the host must use same IP
          multicast group number. This does not require any network operator involvement.
          </t>
  
        </section>

        <section anchor="source-security" title="Intrinsic source-control security">

	  <t>
	  SSM is implicitly secure against unauthorized/undesired sources.
	  Receivers only receive packets from the sources they explicitly specify
          in their IGMP/MLD membreship messages, as opposed to ASM where any host
          can send traffic to a group address and have it transmitted to all receivers. 
          With PIM-SSM, traffic from sources not requested by any receiver will
          be discarded by the first-hop router (FHR) of that source, minimizing source
          attacks against shared network bandwidth and receivers.
          </t>
  
          <t>
          This benefit is particularily important in interdomain deployments because
          there are no standardized solutions for ASM control of sources and the most
          common intradomain operational practices such as Access Control Lists
          (ACL) on senders FHR are not feasible for interdomain deployments.
          </t>

      <section title="Deprecating use of ASM for interdomain multicast">
	<t>
	This document recommends that the use of ASM is deprecated
	for interdomain multicast, and thus implicitly, that hosts and
	routers that support such interdomain applications
	fully support SSM and its associated protocols.
	Best current practices for deploying interdomain multicast using SSM
	are documented in <xref target="RFC8313"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	The recommendation applies to the use of ASM between domains where 
	either MSDP (IPv4) or Embedded-RP (IPv6) is used.
        </t>
        <t>
	An interdomain use of ASM multicast in the context of this document
        is one where PIM-SM with RPs/MSDP/Embedded-RP
        is run on routers operated by two or more separate administrative entities
        (domains, organisations).
	</t>
        <t>
	The more inclusive interpretation of this recommendation is that it also
        extends to the case where PIM may only be operated in a single operator
        domain, but where user hosts or non-PIM network edge devices are under
        different operator control. A typical example of this case is an SP providing
        IPTV (single operator domain for PIM) to subscribers operating an
        IGMP proxy home gateway and IGMPv3/MLDv2 hosts (computer, tablets, set-top boxes).
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Including network support for IGMPv3 / MLDv2">

	<t>
	This document recommends that all hosts, router platforms and 
	security appliances supporting multicast
	support IGMPv3 <xref target="RFC3376"/> and MLDv2 <xref target="RFC3810"/>
        (based on the version IP they intend to support).
	The updated IPv6 Node Requirements RFC <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6434-bis"/>
	states that MLDv2 support is a MUST in all implementations.
	Such support is already widespread in common host and router platforms.
	</t>
	<t>
	Further guidance on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 is given in
	<xref target="RFC4604"/>.
	</t>
     	<t>
        Multicast snooping is often used limit the flooding of multicast traffic
        in a layer 2 network.  With snooping, a L2 switch will monitor IGMP/MLD
	messages and only forward multicast traffic out host ports that have 
	interested receivers connected.
	Such snooping capability should therefore support IGMPv3 and MLDv2.
        There is further discussion in <xref target="RFC4541"/>.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Building application support for SSM">
	<t>
	The recommendation to use SSM for interdomain multicast means that 
	applications should properly trigger the sending of IGMPv3/MLDv2 messages.
	It should be noted, however, there is a wide range of applications today 
	that only support ASM.  In many cases this is due to application developers
	being unaware of the operational concerns of networks.  This document serves to 
	provide clear direction for application developers to support SSM.
	</t>
	<t>
	It is often thought that ASM is required for multicast applications
	where there are multiple sources. However,
	RFC 4607 also describes how SSM can be used instead of PIM-SM
	for multi-party applications:
	</t>
	<t>
	<list style="empty">
	<t>"SSM can be used to
   	build multi-source applications where all participants' identities
   	are not known in advance, but the multi-source "rendezvous"
   	functionality does not occur in the network layer in this case.  Just
   	like in an application that uses unicast as the underlying transport,
   	this functionality can be implemented by the application or by an
   	application-layer library."
	</t>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
	Some useful considerations for multicast applications can be found
	in  <xref target="RFC3170"/>.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="guidance" title="Developing application guidance: SSM, ASM, service discovery">
      
        <t>
        Applications with many-to-many communication patterns can create more
        (S,G) state than feasible for networks, whether the source discovery is
        done by ASM with PIM-SM or at the application level and SSM/PIM-SM.
        These applications are not best supported by neithre SSM/PIM-SSM nor ASM/PIM-SM.
        </t>
      
        <t>
        Instead, these applications are better served by routing protocols that do
        not create (S,G) such as Bidir-PIM. As of today, Unfortunately, many applications
        simply use ASM for service discovery, for example by clients sending IP multicast
        packets to elicit unicast replies from server(s). Deploying any form of IP
        multicast solely in support of such service discovery is in general not recommended
        (complexity, control, ...) but instead dedicated service discovery via DNS <xref target="RFC6763"/>
        </t>

        <t>Best practices should be developed to explain when to use SSM in application,
        when ASM without (S,G) state in the network is better, or when dedicated
        service-discovery mechanisms should be used.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Preferring SSM applications intradomain">

        <t>
        If feasible, it is recommended for applications to use SSM even if they
        are initially only meant to be used in intradomain environments supporting ASM. 
	Because PIM-SSM is a subset of PIM-SM, existing intradomain PIM-SM networks
	are automatically compatible with SSM applications. Thus, SSM applications  
	can operate alongside existing ASM applications.
        SSM's benefits of simplified address management and significantly reduced
	operational complexity apply equally to intradomain use.
      	</t>
        <t>However, for some applications it may be prohibitively difficult to
        add support for source discovery, so intradomain ASM may still be appropriate.
	</t>

      </section>
	
      <section title="Documenting an ASM/SSM protocol mapping mechanism">
	<t>
	In the case of existing ASM applications that cannot readily be ported to SSM,
	it may be possible to use some form of protocol mapping, i.e., to have a 
	mechanism to translate a (*,G) join or leave to a (S,G) join or leave, for 
	a specific source, S.  The general challenge in performing such mapping is 
	determining where the configured source address, S, comes from.
	</t>
	<t>
	There are existing vendor-specific mechanisms deployed that achieve this function,
	but none are documented in IETF documents.  This may be a useful 
	area for the IETF to work on as an interim
	transition mechanism. However, these mechanisms would introduce additional 
	administrative burdens, along with the need for some form of address management, 
	neither of which are required in SSM.  Hence, this should not be considered a
	a long-term solution.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Not filtering ASM addressing between domains">
	<t>
	A key benefit of SSM is that the receiver specifies the source-group tuple 
	when signaling interest in a multicast stream.  Hence, the group address need 
	not be globally unique, so there is no need for multicast address allocation
	as long the reserved SSM range is used.
	</t>
      	<t>
	Despite the deprecation of interdomain ASM, it is recommended that operators 
	should not filter ASM group ranges at domain boundaries, as some form of 
	ASM-SSM mappings may continue to be used for some time.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="precluding" title="Not precluding Intradomain ASM">
      	<t>
	The use of ASM within a single multicast domain such as a campus or
	enterprise is still relatively common today. There are even global
        enterprise networks that have successfully been using
        PIM-SM for many years. The operators of such networks most often
        use Anycast-RP <xref target="RFC4610"/> or MSDP (with IPv4) for RP 
	resilience, at the expense of the extra operational complexity. 
	These existing practices are unaffected by this document.
	</t>

        <t>In the past decade, Bidir-PIM too has seen deployments to scale
        interdomain ASM deployments beyond the capabilities of PIM-SM. This too
        is unaffected by this document, instead it is encouraged where
        necessary due to application requirements (see <xref target="guidance"/>.</t>
        
	<t>
	This document does also not preclude continued use of ASM with multiple
        PIM-SM domains inside organisations, such as with IPv4 MSDP or IPv6 Embedded-RP.
	This includes organizations that are federations and have appropriate, non-standardized
        mechanisms to deal with the interdomain ASM issues explained in <xref target="advantages"/>.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Evolving PIM deployments for SSM">

      	<t>
        Existing PIM-SM deployments can usually be used to run SSM/PIM-SM applications
        with no or little changes. In some widely available router implentations of PIM-SM,
        PIM-SSM is simply enabled by default in the designated SSM address spaces whener
        PIM-SM is configuring/enabled. In other implementations, simple configuration options
        exist to enable it. This allows to easily migrate ASM applications to SSM/PIM-SSM
        solely through application side development/configuration work: adding above mentioned
        source-signaling via IGMPv3/MLDv2 and using SSM addresses. No network actions are
        required for this transitioning: Unchanged ASM applications can continue to co-exist
        without issues.
        </t>
       
        <t>When running PIM-SM, IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership reports may also result in
        the desired PIM-SSM (S,G) operations and bypass any RP procedures, but this is not
        standardized but depends on implementation and may require additional configuration
        in available products.  In general, it is recommended to always use SSM address space
        for SSM applications. For example, the interaction of IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership
        reports and Bidir-PIM is undefined and may not result in forwarding of any traffic.
        </t>

        <t>
        Note that this migration recommendations do not include the considerations when
        or how to evolve those intradomain applications best served by ASM/Bidir-PIM from PIM-SM
        to Bidir-PIM. This may also be important but is outside the scope of this document.
        </t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Future interdomain ASM work">

      <t>
      Future work may attempt to overcome current limitations of ASM solutions,
      such as interdomain deployment solutions for Bidir-PIM, or source access control
      mechaisms for IPv6 PIM-SM with embedded-RP. Such work could modify or amend the
      recommendations of this document (like any future IETF standards/BCP work).
      </t>

      <t>
      Nevertheless, this document does not believe that any ASM solution, even with
      such future work, can ever provide the same intrinsic security and network and address management
      simplicity as SSM (see <xref target="advantages"/>). Instead, this document believes that
      future work for general purpose interdomain IP multicast is better spent on the SSM items
      listed in <xref target="recommendations"/>.
      </t>

    </section>


    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	This document adds no new security considerations. It instead
        removes security issues incurred by interdomain ASM with PIM-SM/MSDP such as
        infrastructure control plane attacks and application and bandwidth/congestion
        attacks from unauthorised sources sending to ASM multicast groups.
	RFC 4609 describes the additional security benefits of using
	SSM instead of ASM.
